# Tetris-with-Cyber-Physical-System-
Development of the Tetris game and a cyber physical system capable of displaying images on an external VGA, using two potentiometers and two buttons as controls, communicated by half-duplex single-channel serial communication. 

The creation of this video game is the result of exceptional collaboration, a testament to the power of creativity and technology united in harmony. With the assistance of an FPGA, we have transcended the boundaries of the conventional, exploring new frontiers in the world of game development.

As a team, we had the honor of representing our institution "Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey" to a renowned company like Intel, showcasing our commitment to excellence and innovation. This project is not only a technical achievement but also a symbol of our ability to work together toward a common goal.
